void welcome() - This function prints a welcome message to the user.
void displayMenu()- This function prints the menu to the user. Your menu must have 2 items - Encode file name and quit. Here is an example:
(E)ncode a file name
(Q)uit
void readOption(char &option). 
This function will read an option and return to the called function through the reference parameter.
You must do validation to make sure that the character is E/e or Q/q and nothing other than that. Use a while loop to do this.
void encode(char encodeFileName[])
This should be a void function that takes 1 char array encodeFileName.
Declare appropriate local variables.
Call the readInput() function to read student’s names and lateFlag.
Call the readInput() function to read Student ID and filename.
Call the readTime() function to read the submitted time. (***new for this level***)
Fill the encodeFileName array based on the six pieces of information adding underscores between.
Start with the student’s names, if the assignment is late, put LATE in the filename and nothing otherwise, add the parsed Student ID, add the time, without the colon, and then finally add the filename.
For example: If late: smith_sue_LATE_5587_1824_prog2.c
If it is not late: smith_sue_5587_1824_prog2.c
Use strncpy() and strcat() functions - refer to Sections 10.4 and 10.5 C-String library functions in your zyBooks.  Look at my example code file.
void readInput(char fName[], char lName[], bool &lateFlag) - overloaded function
This void function should take 2 char arrays and 1 bool variable by reference.
It reads the student’s first name, last name and if the assignment is late or not. Student last name (e.g. Smith) (char array). Student first name (e.g. Sue) (char array)
Make sure all character data for the student’s name is lowercase - you may write a function to convert a cstring to all lowercase.
If the assignment was late or not (e.g., Y or N) (bool var). Must do data validation for this.
Hint: Remember an overloaded function has the same function name but different types of parameters or the number of parameters are different.
void readInput(char parsedID[], char fileName[]) - overloaded function
This void function should take 1 char array for the parsed 4 digit Student ID that will be returned and another char array for the filename.
The Student ID (e.g., 977-15-5587) (char array) is a local variable. Use the strncpy() function to copy from position 7 till the end of the string. strncpy(parsedID, stdID + 7, 4) will copy 4 characters from the 7th position in the stdID string to the parsedID string. Check out this example code file.
The name of the file (e.g., prog2.cpp) (char array)
void readTime(char strTime[]) (***new for this level***)
This is a void function that should read the time from the user as 2 integers and return one char array by reference (that is the strTime array).
The time read from the user will be in military time (e.g.. 18:24 for 6:24pm) (2 ints, one for hour and one for mins). Check out this example code file to extract the numbers and convert them to a cstring. This example is not quite sophisticated. You must do data validation by checking the hours are between 0 and 24 and the minutes are between 0 and 60.
This function must do data validation for the numbers and the HH:MM format. Make sure the colon : is used to separate the mins and hours.
int main()
Declare appropriate local variables.
In an appropriate loop call the functions and output the encoded file name.
Repeat the menu in the loop until the user chooses to quit.
main() should do nothing more than the above steps.
Please follow ALL the instructions to submit your file in the Criteria for Success section below.
Criteria for Success
Test your program using the following sample runs, making sure you get the same output when using the given inputs (in blue).
Make sure to test your program with different sets of data.


Welcome to my fileName encoding program!!

Please pick an option below:
(e)Encode a file name
(q)quit
>>e
This program will ask you a few questions and generate an encoded fileName based on your answers.
Enter your last name: Iyer
Enter your first name: GD
Was your assignment Late (y/n)? Y
Enter your Student-ID (format: 222-22-2222): 234-05-4556
Enter the file name: a05.cpp
Enter the time submitted (military time - ex: 18:24 for 6:24pm): 13:45
Your encoded file name is: iyer_gd_LATE_4556_1345_a05.cpp
Please pick an option below:
(e)Encode a file name
(q)quit
>>b
Invalid option! Please try again!!
Please pick an option below:
(e)Encode a file name
(q)quit
>>q
Thank you for using my fileName generator!
